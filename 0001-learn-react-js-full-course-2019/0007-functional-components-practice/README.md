# Functional Components Practice

## Practice Problem

### Objectives

1. Set up the basic React code from scratch
2. Create a functional component called `MyInfo` that returns the following UI:
   a. Am `h1` with your name
   b. A paragraph with a little blurb about yourself
   c. An ordered list of the top 3 vacation spots you'd like to visit
3. Render an instance of that functional component to the browser

### Extra challenge

Learn on your own (Google) how you can add some style to
your page. (We will also cover this in an upcoming lesson).

## Example Demo

Run the demo project with the following command

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Changes to the source code will automatically trigger a front-end update
