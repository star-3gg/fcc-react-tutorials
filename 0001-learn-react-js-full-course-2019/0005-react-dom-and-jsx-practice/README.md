# ReactDOM & JSX Practice

Let's apply what we have learned to a practice problem

## problem

### Objective

Fill in the boilerplate React code required to render an
unordered list (`<ul>`) to the page. The list should contain 3 list items
(`<li>`) with anything in them you want.

### HINTS:

Import the libraries you need first
use one of the libraries to render some `JSX` to the page.

## Run solution

Run the demo project with the following command

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Changes to the source code will automatically trigger a front-end update
